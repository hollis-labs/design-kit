/**
 * @hollis-labs/eslint-config-design — the gate.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE: a component may name a token, never a value. It covers scale as
 * much as color; `text-[13px]` names a value exactly as much as `#1a1b26` does.
 *
 * Why a gate and not a guideline: every number in the drift measurement is that
 * guideline being ignored by someone who meant well. And since Chrispian chose to
 * EXTEND Tailwind's type scale rather than close it, `text-[13px]` stays
 * representable — so lint is not a backstop to the type scale, it is the
 * enforcement mechanism for it.
 *
 * The vocabulary is never hardcoded here. See vocabulary.js.
