/**
 * A miss is a classification, never an exception.
 *
 * The failure these assertions exist to prevent is the one settled answer #4 names:
 * a silently dropped envelope is how an agent's message disappears with no trace.
 * So `resolve` must never throw and must never leave a caller with nothing to draw —
 * and the four codes must stay distinguishable, because they are four different
 * things for an operator to do.
