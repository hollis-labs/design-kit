# Image and InlineCitation verification

CW-20261002-0049 PR A, measured 2026-10-02. Primary source is the branch tree;
upstream pin is ai-elements 1.9.0 at 6a9d5b1 (Apache-2.0). No new dependencies,
manifest/lock/version/range changes, publication or application adoption.
HoverCard needs the next design-components release (unreleased); local built
siblings demonstrate the candidate, not registry 0.3.0 compatibility.

## Behavior and browser

Eight RTL tests exercise native image src/alt/metadata/handlers, decorative
alternative text, pager wraparound, inactive hidden pages, controlled-host
acceptance, index normalization/list shrink, empty/single-page navigation,
prevented/disabled clicks, controlled hover requests, arbitrary source text and
clear outside-carousel failure. No `it.skip`. Real open PreviewCard portals have
a known jsdom/layout hang also recorded by design-components and ModelSelector;
portal positioning, exposed accessibility and keyboard interactions are tested
in Chromium instead of replacing the production component in the RTL test.

[Browser receipt](browser.json) identifies source f24c4c7 and records 21 captures:
all ten built-in themes in light/dark plus a 390px reduced-motion viewport.
The host fixture uses [demo/image-citation.tsx](../../demo/image-citation.tsx).
Source and design-components/design-tokens builds were frozen in scratch before
capture; the final captures avoid live rebuild/HMR changes. The new kit source
is the source revision in the receipt. Native image decode/size/alt/mediaType,
exposed `aria-hidden=false` popup controls, Tab into previous/next, Shift+Tab to
the trigger, Enter/Space wraparound, continuation to the following host control,
Escape returning focus, pointer transfer into the popup, no mobile overflow,
reduced-motion transition removal and zero page errors all passed.

The first Chromium probe showed that simply exposing the HoverCard body did
not preserve focus order: Tab went to the following host action and the popup
closed before next. Local focus handoffs now preserve the trigger's position
in host tab order and close through Base UI when focus leaves the body.
The host controls any controlled `open` callback and can decline it.

| Theme | Light | Dark |
| --- | --- | --- |
| nanite-default | [capture](nanite-default-light.png) | [capture](nanite-default-dark.png) |
| dir-a | [capture](dir-a-light.png) | [capture](dir-a-dark.png) |
| dir-b | [capture](dir-b-light.png) | [capture](dir-b-dark.png) |
| dir-d | [capture](dir-d-light.png) | [capture](dir-d-dark.png) |
| dir-e | [capture](dir-e-light.png) | [capture](dir-e-dark.png) |
| dir-f | [capture](dir-f-light.png) | [capture](dir-f-dark.png) |
| sysop-amber-phosphor | [capture](sysop-amber-phosphor-light.png) | [capture](sysop-amber-phosphor-dark.png) |
| sysop-green-phosphor | [capture](sysop-green-phosphor-light.png) | [capture](sysop-green-phosphor-dark.png) |
| sysop-p4-white | [capture](sysop-p4-white-light.png) | [capture](sysop-p4-white-dark.png) |
| sysop-hi-contrast | [capture](sysop-hi-contrast-light.png) | [capture](sysop-hi-contrast-dark.png) |

[Mobile reduced motion](mobile-reduced-motion.png). The illustrative source is
host-created SVG data; its demo-only dark inversion shows host image treatment.
The library's Image leaves the supplied source unchanged.

Reproduce: build siblings first, serve the demo in a scratch Vite/React fixture
with Tailwind and the design-token CSS, registering kit-chat source and built
design-components classes. Use a frozen copy during root builds. Run
`docs/fixtures/image-citation-browser.mjs` with `MEDIA_URL` pointing to loopback,
`MEDIA_SCREENSHOTS` to scratch, `MEDIA_SOURCE_COMMIT` identifying that fixture,
and `PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE` if Playwright is installed outside this repository.
Playwright is verification tooling, not a kit dependency.

## Packed consumer

[Consumer receipt](consumer.json), packed from source f24c4c7, records successful production build and Chromium render. The kit-chat tarball SHA256 is 36492b458a22add0b40f158c223fcbf2ef9962e53a2ab46360280c5f385f3016. Packed LICENSE matches source and retains the full canonical Apache suffix. The consumer imports
only ChatStream from the main entry, the four documented stylesheets, and plain
React content. Built local sibling tarballs are needed for unreleased primitives;
all installed packages are ordinary unpacked npm packages, no workspace links.
No Streamdown, markdown import/styles, embla or AI SDK is installed or imported.

## Limits

Chromium only; no screen-reader or other-engine audit. No production application,
model/transport, remote image service, content policy, host Blob URL lifecycle,
or external citation destination was exercised. No publishing or app migration.
The five-gate output, including actual kit-chat test file/count lines and zero
design violations, is pasted in the PR body.
