# OpenIn evidence — CW-20261002-0049 PR B

The authored source port is pinned to AI Elements 1.9.0 at
6a9d5b1822ffb10bba4bd97175f01edd7d8651cd. The source header and upstream inventory
record replacing upstream provider-specific URL/query construction and inline brand
marks with a required host href/label/icon catalog. No brand exports, provider
defaults, query prop, content serialization, preload/fetch or dependency is added.

Five Vitest tests exercise real Base UI Menu items inline: exact HTTP(S) href and
new-tab attributes, rejected executable/data/file/mail/relative/malformed destinations
remaining disabled non-link rows with no click callback, empty catalog, inert text
labels/decorative consumer icons, and host catalog updates/custom trigger label.
No popup is opened in jsdom because Base UI's positioned portal has a known jsdom
hang; Chromium verifies the actual popup and link activation. No test is skipped.

`verify-browser.mjs` mounts demo/open-in.tsx in a scratch Vite React/Tailwind host.
It verifies keyboard opening, Base UI focus navigation (disabled rows stay
keyboard-discoverable but cannot activate), Escape focus return and Tab progression,
empty-trigger disabling, rejected-row touch/keyboard inertness, and mobile overflow.
It records zero destination requests before activation, then exactly the original
host-encoded HTTP(S) destination request. A native touch activation opens a new tab;
the originating page stays put, window.opener is null and document.referrer is empty.
The test route fulfills the activated destination locally; it does not contact a
real external provider. Consumer nodes can carry their own behavior; the fixture's
icons are noninteractive local SVG nodes. No page errors occurred.

Twenty desktop screenshots cover all ten built-in themes in light/dark with the
menu open, plus one mobile screenshot. Theme/mode attributes live on html; the
script waits for theme transitions before measuring/capturing. browser.json
records computed menu colors and behavior. Representative light/dark screenshots
were visually inspected. Import Tailwind, design-tokens/design-tokens.css,
design-components/source.css and kit-chat/source.css; register the demo and source
when serving unbuilt TSX. Run the script with PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE, PROOF_OUTPUT and
optional BASE_URL. Only existing workspace tools are needed.

OpenIn's direct Button/DropdownMenu imports already exist in published
 design-components 0.3.0. The integrated kit-chat package includes other exports
using Collapsible/HoverCard and **needs next design-components release (unreleased)**.
consumer.json records an isolated packed ChatStream-only consumer with packed
workspace design-components/bindings, registry design-tokens, no workspace links
and no installed Streamdown. Its production bundle/render verifies the optional
markdown boundary, not release readiness or CSS coverage. root-graph.json records
the built main graph and absence of Streamdown/Shiki/ANSI peer references. The
package license retains the canonical complete Apache text once (249 lines,
one TERMS AND CONDITIONS heading after integration of PR A).

All five integrated gates and actual kit-chat test counts are recorded in the PR.
Limits: Chromium only; no provider catalog/prompt export/content encoding or
consumer asset licensing policy, no real destination network, no version/range/
manifest/lock changes, and no publishing. Hosts own destination/content consent
and all asset/URL choices.
