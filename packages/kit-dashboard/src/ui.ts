/**
 * The dashboard idiom. Kit components only.
 *
 * THIS BARREL USED TO BE THE PROBLEM. It exported the 23 shadcn primitives, the
 * idiom-free root components, `lib/status`, `lib/theme` and the hooks — and
 * `index.ts` was `export * from './ui'`. So an app that wanted a Button took the
 * whole dense-operations idiom, which is the epic's founding diagnosis, confirmed
 * at the barrel level rather than inferred from adoption.
 *
 * It no longer re-exports the base set, deliberately. A consumer takes
 * `@hollis-labs/design-components` for a Button and this package for the idiom.
 * Re-exporting them here would rebuild the bundle boundary the split exists to
 * remove, and it would make the two packages' surfaces silently diverge the first
 * time one of them changed.
