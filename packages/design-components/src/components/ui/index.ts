/**
 * The vendored primitives, in one barrel.
 *
 * These are shadcn components on Base UI (`@base-ui/react`), a peer.
 * Some bind Base UI components; Badge and ButtonGroupText use useRender.
 * Others are substrate-independent (table, textarea, card) or wrap their
 * existing peers (command/cmdk, sonner).
 *
 * `export *` is safe for tree-shaking here: the package declares
 * `sideEffects: ["**\/*.css"]` and the build preserves modules, so a consumer
 * importing one Button gets one Button.
