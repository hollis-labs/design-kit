# @hollis-labs/design-bindings

## 0.1.0 — 2026-09-11

First release, alongside the five other packages in this repo. The set shares a
version number; the release record for all of it is the repo's
[`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/hollis-labs/design-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

**The binding contract** — which component draws a wire kind, how the payload reaches
it, and at what trust. It names a component *identity*, never an appearance value,
which is what keeps it from becoming a second appearance authority.

This is the layer the portfolio did not have: every app wrote the schema-to-component
mapping by hand, which is the drift mechanism the rest of these packages exist to
close. Zero dependencies; ships TypeScript source.
