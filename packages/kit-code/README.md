# @hollis-labs/kit-code

Private, unpublished `0.0.0`. Code presentation uses the design-kit contract.

- **CodeBlock** displays source as React text, with optional hidden line numbers, a filename/header/actions family, an accessible copy button and shared Base UI language selectors. The root entry does not load Shiki.
- **Snippet** composes a command prefix, a read-only Input and a labelled copy button. Give `SnippetInput` an `aria-label` or associated label; copying uses the supplied code, never the prefix.
- **FileTree** uses native disclosure/selection buttons and groups, with controlled or uncontrolled immutable expansion. It makes no incomplete ARIA tree/roving-focus claim.
- **StackTrace** preserves unknown frames, displays paths as text by default, and delegates valid coordinates to an optional host callback. Its copy action preserves the raw trace.
- **TestResults** composes summaries, bounded progress, independently controlled Base UI suites and labelled pass/fail/skipped/running statuses. Zero duration remains visible.
- **`/terminal`** renders untrusted terminal output (ANSI colour and style) on the optional `ansi-to-react` peer: React text only, no links, no inline colours, control sequences other than colour removed, at most the last 65,536 characters rendered. See *Terminal* below.
- **`/highlight`** creates one host-owned Shiki core highlighter using the JS regexp engine and explicitly selected grammars. Its structural plugin serves both CodeBlock and `kit-chat/markdown`. No global caches, downloads, per-language singleton or markdown dependency.

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-tokens/design-tokens.css";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-components/source.css";
@import "@hollis-labs/kit-code/source.css";
```

Plain code works without installing the optional highlighting peer:

```tsx
import { CodeBlock, CodeBlockCopyButton, Snippet, SnippetInput, SnippetCopyButton } from '@hollis-labs/kit-code'

<CodeBlock code={source}><CodeBlockCopyButton onError={showError} /></CodeBlock>
<Snippet code="npm test"><SnippetInput aria-label="Command" /><SnippetCopyButton onError={showError} /></Snippet>
```

Install `shiki@^4.5.0` to opt in. Create the instance outside rendering and share it:

```tsx
import typescript from 'shiki/langs/typescript.mjs'
import json from 'shiki/langs/json.mjs'
import { createCodeHighlighter } from '@hollis-labs/kit-code/highlight'
import { CodeBlock } from '@hollis-labs/kit-code'
import { ChatMarkdown } from '@hollis-labs/kit-chat/markdown'

const highlighter = await createCodeHighlighter({ langs: [typescript, json] })
// The host retains this instance across both surfaces.
<CodeBlock code={source} language="typescript" highlighter={highlighter} />
<ChatMarkdown plugins={{ code: highlighter }}>{markdown}</ChatMarkdown>
// Call highlighter.dispose() after its consumers have unmounted.
```

Kit-code does not install Streamdown or `@streamdown/code`. Streamdown 2.6 accepts
the shared plugin; its highlighting lives in optional plugins rather than a
mandatory Shiki dependency. The host owns kit-chat/markdown's optional peer setup.
If initialization rejects, keep CodeBlock's plain rendering and handle the error
in the host. Unknown/unloaded languages and disposed instances also fall back to
plain code. Only TypeScript, JSON and Bash grammars have been exercised here;
other JS-engine-compatible grammars are caller-selected, not promised.

Token colours reference contract CSS variables, so theme/mode changes require no
second highlighter. The existing syntax roles supply keys, strings, numbers,
booleans and null; comments use muted text and functions use primary. No GitHub
palette, inline HTML injection or host-executed code is involved.

Copy buttons report missing/denied Clipboard API access through `onError`, block
concurrent writes, compose consumer `onClick` (preventDefault cancels copying),
clean up feedback timers and tie copied feedback to the exact source. Clipboard
access requires a secure context. The host supplies labels for language selectors
and owns value/onValueChange. Component names follow upstream, with Base UI's
`render` props replacing `asChild`.

FileTree, StackTrace and TestSuite use Collapsible; FileTree and StackTrace also
use the shared controlled-state helper. Each **needs next design-components release (unreleased)**.
This private workspace is not a claim of
compatibility with registry design-components 0.3.0. Nothing publishes here.
The remaining component slices have not landed yet.

## Terminal

`@hollis-labs/kit-code/terminal` is opt-in: install `ansi-to-react@^6.2.6` (BSD-3-Clause; its `anser`,
`escape-carriage` and `linkify-it` are MIT) to use it. The main entry never imports it.

```tsx
import { Terminal } from '@hollis-labs/kit-code/terminal'

<Terminal output={log} isStreaming={running} onClear={() => setLog('')} />
// or compose: Terminal > TerminalHeader (TerminalTitle, TerminalStatus, TerminalActions
//   (TerminalCopyButton, TerminalClearButton)) + TerminalContent
```

No stylesheet to import beyond `@hollis-labs/kit-code/source.css`: the colour rules are Tailwind
utilities in the shipped JavaScript, so they follow the theme and mode (including a `[data-theme]` on a
subtree). The sixteen ANSI colours map onto contract tokens (red `danger`, green `success`, yellow `warning`,
blue and cyan `info`, magenta `brand`, black `fg-muted`, white `fg`; backgrounds use the `-muted`
variants), plus bold, dim, italic, underline and strike-through. **Not styled, on purpose:** 256-colour
above 15 and true colour (the renderer emits no colour value for them, so they show in the normal text
colour), reverse and blink (shown as plain text), and conceal, because output must not be able to hide
its own text. In a single-hue theme (the phosphor themes) two roles can share the text colour.

**Terminal output is untrusted** (a tool, a script or a remote host wrote it), and this is what is done
about it. The evidence is in `docs/terminal-evidence/` (`security-audit.md`, `browser.json`, `ansi-cost.md`).

- **No HTML, no links.** The peer is used with `useClasses` and `linkify={false}`; it renders React text,
  so `<script>`, `<img onerror>`, entities and attribute fragments stay inert text. Raw URLs are not
  linkified and no `<a>` is ever produced; there are no inline colour styles and every class comes from
  the renderer's fixed set, never from the input.
- **Control sequences other than colour are removed before rendering:** window titles, OSC 8 hyperlinks
  (the peer would otherwise print `javascript:...` as visible text), cursor and screen control, device
  strings, stray ESC and C0/C1 bytes. Every pattern is linear: no nested quantifiers or overlapping
  alternatives, and OSC/device payloads are capped at 4,096 characters so an unterminated one cannot
  swallow the output that follows.
- **Work is bounded by size.** Only the last `maxChars` (default 65,536) are rendered, starting on a line
  boundary, with a visible "Showing the last N of M characters" note; the host keeps the full output and
  Copy takes all of it. Measured with ansi-to-react 6.2.6 (`demo/scripts/ansi-cost.mjs`), 6 MiB of
  worst-case input took 4-23 s to render alone and takes 0.1-0.2 s through `Terminal`. Raise `maxChars` only
  for output you trust.
- **Copy is the visible text**, with every escape sequence removed (and `\r`/`\r\n` as newlines), not the
  raw bytes: escape sequences pasted into a terminal act. Computed when the button is pressed.
- The log is a focusable `role="log"` region (`aria-live` off, so streaming does not flood a screen
  reader), the streaming status is `role="status"`, copy and clear are labelled, the cursor stops pulsing
  under `prefers-reduced-motion`. Clipboard access needs a secure context and reports failure through
  `onError`.

Source ports retain AI Elements' Apache-2.0 provenance; full terms follow the
original MIT notice in LICENSE. Shiki is MIT; optional ansi-to-react is
BSD-3-Clause. Neither optional peer enters the main module graph.

Run `npm run test:run --workspace @hollis-labs/kit-code`, or the demo with
`npm run demo --workspace @hollis-labs/kit-code`. Light/dark browser evidence across
all built-in themes is in `docs/code-block-evidence/`.

FileTree `expanded`/`defaultExpanded` accept Sets; expansion requests create a new
Set and never mutate the supplied Set. Controlled expansion waits for the host.
Selection is host-owned through `selectedPath`/`onSelect`; without a callback,
files are read-only text. Folder expansion and selection have separate buttons.
Place row buttons in `actions` or direct `FileTreeActions` children of a file;
keep interactive controls out of names/icons. StackTrace uses one disclosure
root: `StackTraceHeader` is its native trigger, direct `StackTraceActions` or
`actions` are siblings, and `StackTraceExpandButton` is a decorative indicator.
Do not put additional interactive controls inside trigger content.
`onFilePathClick(path, line?, column?)` delegates navigation entirely to the host.
Unknown/malformed frames and lines over 1,000 characters remain text without
regex matching; `showInternalFrames={false}` only filters
recognized internal paths. Test progress measures passed plus failed tests,
clamped to the finite positive total; skipped tests remain in the summary.

Use `?view=inspection` in the demo. Theme/mode screenshots and browser interaction
receipts for this slice are in `docs/inspection-evidence/`.
