# Vendoring AI Elements

Read the pinned source before porting it. AI Elements is copied as source, never
installed as a dependency. The current pin and file inventory live in
[the upstream log](upstream-versions.md). Keep upstream component and sub-component
names so later source diffs remain useful.

## Provenance header

Retain this format from the batch brief. For Vercel-authored `packages/elements/src/` files, use the actual upstream path,
full commit URL and actual
vendoring date. List each substantive change under Divergences. Place the header
before imports or a `"use client"` directive; preserve any original file notices.

```tsx
/**
 * Vendored from AI Elements (Vercel, Apache-2.0).
 * Upstream: packages/elements/src/<name>.tsx
 * Source:   https://github.com/vercel/ai-elements/blob/6a9d5b1822ffb10bba4bd97175f01edd7d8651cd/packages/elements/src/<name>.tsx
 * Version:  ai-elements 1.9.0 @ 6a9d5b1 (2026-08-21); vendored 2026-10-02
 * Divergences: <one line each: Radix->Base UI, `ai` types removed, framer-motion->CSS, tokens, ...>
 */
```

This notice identifies modified files. It does not replace the upstream licence.

### shadcn/ui primitives have a different origin

`packages/shadcn-ui/components/ui/*` is the MIT shadcn/ui primitive layer copied
into the AI Elements repository, not Vercel-authored Apache source. Retain its
own copyright. [shadcn/ui's licence](https://github.com/shadcn-ui/ui/blob/main/LICENSE.md)
was checked directly on 2026-10-02: `Copyright (c) 2023 shadcn`, MIT.
Use this header for primitives; the Source/Version fields identify the pinned
copy read, not a claim that it was authored by Vercel:

```tsx
/**
 * Vendored from shadcn/ui (MIT), via the pinned AI Elements copy.
 * Copyright (c) 2023 shadcn
 * Upstream: packages/shadcn-ui/components/ui/<name>.tsx
 * Source:   https://github.com/vercel/ai-elements/blob/6a9d5b1822ffb10bba4bd97175f01edd7d8651cd/packages/shadcn-ui/components/ui/<name>.tsx
 * Version:  ai-elements 1.9.0 @ 6a9d5b1 (2026-08-21); vendored 2026-10-02
 * Divergences: <one line each: Radix->Base UI, tokens, ...>
 */
```

## Licence and attribution travel with each package

The canonical reference texts live in
[third-party/ai-elements-LICENSE.txt](third-party/ai-elements-LICENSE.txt) and
[third-party/shadcn-ui-LICENSE.txt](third-party/shadcn-ui-LICENSE.txt).
These docs are not shipped by this package. A docs-only convention PR does not
change a package's shipped licence or assert that it already includes ports.

In the PR that **first takes source**, each receiving package appends the
applicable reference text to its own package-root `LICENSE`, retaining its
original licence first. Introduce the section with the origin, licence and local
file scope, so Hollis Labs MIT terms do not purport to replace upstream terms.
Vercel elements require the copyright/notice and full Apache-2.0 text; shadcn
primitives require the shadcn copyright and full MIT text. A package taking both
includes both. Retain any additional notices from the particular source files.

If the package has no `LICENSE` (for example kit-chat), the first vendoring PR
creates an MIT `LICENSE` matching `packages/kit-observe/LICENSE` for original
Hollis Labs code, then appends the applicable third-party section. State in that
PR that adding the file changes the package's tarball.

npm includes the package-root `LICENSE` even with a `files` allowlist; verify
this with `npm pack --dry-run --json --ignore-scripts` after building the package.
A repository-only licence or a link alone is insufficient for a shipped tarball.
Consumers redistributing the port must retain these notices and the licence text.

The pinned AI Elements checkout has no `NOTICE` file. At each upstream update
check again: if one appears, retain its relevant attribution verbatim in the
package's `LICENSE` third-party section as well. Preserve source-file copyright,
patent, trademark and attribution notices too. Do not substitute a newly written
notice for an upstream one. See [Apache-2.0 section 4](https://www.apache.org/licenses/LICENSE-2.0).
An independently sourced file needs its own verified licence and attribution;
being adjacent to AI Elements code does not establish its origin.

## Port checklist

1. Read the actual pinned source and its notices. Record its path and revision in
   the package's upstream log and add the origin-appropriate header above to each copied file.
2. Add the package-local licence section before taking source. Inspect the built
   tarball manifest for `LICENSE`; retain any upstream `NOTICE` attribution.
3. Replace Radix with Base UI, `asChild` with `render`, and controllable-state
   helpers with local presentational state where needed. Verify available Base UI
   primitives and actual controlled/uncontrolled, keyboard and focus behavior.
4. Remove `ai` and `@ai-sdk/*` imports/types. Own the presentational prop types:
   props down, callbacks up; no stores or fetching.
5. Name tokens, never values, for colour and scale. Use the contract's typography
   and radius names (`rounded-panel`, `rounded-control`) and shared `cn()`.
6. Replace framer-motion with CSS. Global keyframes remain opt-in through the
   package's separate stylesheet; importing a component must not install them.
7. Put heavy optional peers behind opt-in subpaths, with documented Tailwind
   source registration. Libraries holding module state remain peers.
8. Keep upstream sub-component names; use shapes rather than wire-kind names.
   Reconcile existing components instead of adding redundant alternatives.
9. Add behavioral tests, a package demo entry, README line and unreleased CHANGELOG
   entry. Update the upstream log with local paths and concrete divergences.
10. Build packages first, then run root typecheck, lint, test:run, build and
    `node .github/scripts/design-rules-gate.mjs`; paste actual output in the PR.
    Include visual evidence in light/dark for affected themes and state what was
    not verified. New packages stay private at 0.0.0; core versions/ranges stay put.

## Updating a port

Diff old and new upstream source, inspect licence changes, then apply relevant
changes deliberately. Update the header, inventory and divergence notes together;
keep historical pin rows. Re-run behavior and visual verification for changed
behavior. No automatic upstream sync and no upstream runtime hotlinks.
