# Expanded Artifact evidence — CW-20261002-0049 PR C

The authored upstream artifact.tsx at AI Elements 1.9.0,
6a9d5b1822ffb10bba4bd97175f01edd7d8651cd, is the primary source for this port.
Its Artifact/header/title/description/close/actions/content names are retained.
ArtifactCard keeps the existing compact Envelope presentation; Artifact is an
expanded viewer with already-rendered host content, not a duplicate card or wire
identity. No renderer, editor, MIME detection, fetching, automatic download or
viewer lifecycle is added. Source header/inventory record the divergences; the
package LICENSE retains full Apache terms once with attribution extended.

Four Vitest tests verify compact/expanded coexistence and inert React text,
action/close host callbacks without form submission or implicit viewer unmount,
required nonempty labels independently of tooltips, disabled action inertness,
no nested buttons, and a labelled focusable content region with host overrides.
No popup is opened in jsdom; no test is skipped. The real Tooltip is verified in
Chromium. This installed Base UI Tooltip does not attach description semantics
itself; ArtifactAction explicitly gives the open tooltip its role/ID and adds
that ID to the action's aria-describedby while preserving any host description.
The optional hint never substitutes for the action's required accessible label.
The closed tooltip adds no dangling description ID.

verify-browser.mjs mounts demo/artifact.tsx in a scratch Vite React/Tailwind host.
It verifies native non-submitting buttons, actual tooltip visibility and ARIA
linkage on keyboard focus, Enter/Space callbacks, native disabled Tab skipping,
Tab into the content pane, PageDown scrolling with the header/close stationary,
inert script-shaped text, touch action/disabled/close/reopen, compact presentation
remaining visible and no mobile overflow. Content has 384px client height and
1496px scroll height in the fixture (the CSS names the contract scale max-h-96).
There are zero external requests or page errors. Hosts own close/reopen state
and any focus restoration when they replace/unmount a viewer.

Twenty desktop screenshots cover all ten built-in themes in light/dark, plus
mobile. Theme/mode attributes live on html; theme transitions settle before
measurement/capture. browser.json contains computed surface colors and behavior.
Representative light/dark screenshots were visually inspected. Use existing
workspace Vite/React/Tailwind tools; import Tailwind, design-tokens/design-tokens.css,
design-components/source.css and kit-chat/source.css, registering demo/source
when serving unbuilt TSX. Run with PLAYWRIGHT_MODULE, PROOF_OUTPUT and optional
BASE_URL. No project dependency, config or service is added.

published-primitives.json records direct Button/Tooltip/cn exports verified in
the registry 0.3.0 tarball. This slice itself uses only published primitives;
integrated kit-chat **needs next design-components release (unreleased)** for
other Collapsible/HoverCard exports. consumer.json records the isolated packed
ChatStream-only production build/Chromium render without Streamdown or workspace
links. That verifies the optional markdown boundary, not release readiness or
consumer CSS coverage. root-graph.json records the built main graph without
Streamdown/Shiki/ANSI references. Full five root gates and actual kit-chat test
counts are recorded in the PR body/CI log.

Limits: Chromium only, host content behavior/asset policies, no viewer focus trap
or renderer/editor/download/network implementation, no version/range/manifest/
lock changes and no publishing. The host owns placement, heading structure,
visibility, content and all callbacks.
