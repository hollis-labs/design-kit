/**
 * Resolution — "can I draw this one, right now?"
 *
 * A MISS IS A CLASSIFICATION, NEVER AN EXCEPTION. This function does not throw, has
 * no failure path, and always returns something a host can draw. That is settled
 * answer #4, and the reason it is stated so strongly is the failure it prevents: a
 * silently dropped envelope is how an agent's message disappears with no trace, and
 * nobody finds out — not the user, who sees a gap, and not the operator, who sees
 * nothing at all.
 *
 * A WIRE KIND WITH NO BINDING IS THE NORMAL CASE. It is what a plugin looks like
 * before a host has decided to draw it. Treating it as an error would make the
 * ordinary state of an extensible system read as a fault.
 *
 * THIS PAIRS WITH go-envelopes' `TypeSupport` (CW-20260910-0122) and the two answer
 * different questions. `CheckSupport` asks, at build time, "do I have a policy for
 * every type?" — it prevents surprise. `resolve` asks, at runtime, "can I draw this
 * one?" — it handles surprise. A host wants both; neither replaces the other.

/**
 * Why a kind will not draw.
 *
 * FOUR CODES, AND THEY ARE FOUR BECAUSE THEY ARE FOUR DIFFERENT OPERATOR ACTIONS.
 * Tangent's resolver makes the same argument for keeping its own codes apart: "we
 * have no idea what this is" and "we know what it is and will not serve it" are
 * different answers, and only the second one is actionable. The test for adding a
 * fifth is not whether it is a distinguishable internal state — it is whether
 * somebody reading it does something different.
 *
 * A code the proposal listed and this does not: `trust_unimplemented`. Tangent needs
 * it because it reads trust classes as strings from a generated table. Here
 * `TrustClass` is a closed union and `TRUST_PROFILES` is a mapped type over it, so
 * an unimplemented class is a compile error rather than a runtime code. It was
 * eliminated by the shape, not dropped.
