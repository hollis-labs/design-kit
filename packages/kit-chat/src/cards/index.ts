/**
 * The card set — the chassis, and the shapes that compose on it.
 *
 * A CARD IS A SHAPE, NOT A WIRE KIND. There is no `ApprovalCard` here and there will
 * not be one: a renderer keyed to a wire kind is the design layer asserting wire
 * identity, which the portfolio's ownership table gives to `go-envelopes`. A host
 * binds ITS kinds to THESE shapes through `@hollis-labs/design-bindings`, and the
 * binding table is host-local by construction. Two of the wire-kind renderers that
 * exist in Nanite today are ADR 0005 boundary violations for Tangent, which is the
 * concrete reason this line is drawn rather than the tidy one.
 *
 * CONSEQUENTLY THIS KIT SHIPS NO DEFAULT BINDING ROWS. A `BindingRequest` names a
 * `kind`, and a kit that implements no kinds has no rows to offer. What it ships
 * instead is the part that IS design: drawing the miss when a kind resolves to
 * nothing — see `card-miss.tsx`.
