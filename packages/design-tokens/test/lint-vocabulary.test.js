/**
 * The integration CW-20260910-0117 is blocked on, tested from THIS side.
 *
 * `@hollis-labs/eslint-config-design` builds its vocabulary by importing this
 * package and reading named exports. It deliberately ships no fallback list —
 * "a lint config that silently substitutes a stale vocabulary is worse than one
 * that refuses to load" — so if this package renames an export, that package
 * stops working rather than working wrongly.
 *
 * That makes the export NAMES part of this package's contract with it, and a
 * contract nobody tests is a convention. This is the test.
