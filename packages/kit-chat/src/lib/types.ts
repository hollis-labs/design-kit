/**
 * The chat item model.
 *
 * WHY A DISCRIMINATED UNION AND NOT A MESSAGE WITH OPTIONAL FIELDS. An
 * optional-field grab-bag lets an author write a "message" that carries a marker's
 * label and no content, and nothing objects until it renders as an empty row. Here
 * `kind` selects the shape, so the invalid combination does not typecheck.
 *
 * AND A CARD IS A SIBLING VARIANT RATHER THAN A FIELD ON A MESSAGE — added by
 * CW-20260910-0129, exactly as this comment predicted it would be. A card that lives
 * *inside* a message forces every consumer of `ChatMessageItem` to know about
 * envelopes, and forces a card to inherit a message's role and author when it has
 * neither. Adding `| ChatCardItem` was additive; unpicking a nested field later
 * would not have been.

 * A card in the transcript.

 * THE CARD ITSELF IS A `ReactNode`, AND THAT IS THE SEAM. This package does not
 * resolve bindings, does not own a binding table, and does not import a renderer: a
 * binding table is host-local by construction, so the host resolves the kind, draws
 * the card and puts the result here. `ChatStream` places it in the transcript and
 * owns nothing about what is inside.
 *
 * `wireKind` RIDES ALONG EVEN THOUGH NOTHING HERE READS IT, because a card is the one
 * item type whose identity is not visible in its own content. It is what a host needs
 * for `key`-ing a `CardBoundary`, what jump-to-message and debugging need, and what
 * every miss card has to name. Carrying it is cheap; recovering it from a rendered
 * `ReactNode` is impossible.
 *
 * THERE IS NO `status` FIELD HERE. A card's resolved state belongs to the card —
 * `ConfirmationCard` takes `priorStatus` directly — and duplicating it on the stream
 * item would create two places that can disagree about whether a decision was made.
