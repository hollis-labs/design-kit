/**
 * @hollis-labs/design-tokens — layer 2 of the Hollis Labs frontend layering.
 *
 * THE ONE RULE: a component may name a token, never a value. This package is
 * the list of names it may name, the types that stop it naming one that does not
 * exist, and default values for both. It covers SCALE as much as colour —
 * `text-[13px]` names a value exactly as much as `#1a1b26` does.
 *
 * Implements docs/token-contract.md (CW-20260910-0111), approved review round 2.
 * No React, no components, no framework. See README.md.

 * The scales — NAMES AND VALUES.
 *
 * `TEXT_SCALE` / `RADIUS_SCALE` / `TRACKING_SCALE` are name → value maps, and
 * exporting the values rather than only the names is a hard requirement from
 * CW-20260910-0117. Its `no-arbitrary-scale` rule cannot tell `text-[13px]`
 * ("restates `text-control`" — an autofix) from `text-[10.5px]` ("off the scale"
 * — a real violation) without them, and those two need different messages. Until
 * these shipped, that package carried its own copy of the values as a documented
 * fallback, flagged in its source as the one place it restates the contract.
 * These exports delete it.
