/**
 * THE SCALE CONTRACT — type, radius and letter-spacing.
 *
 * The one rule covers scale as much as colour, and scale is the larger half of
 * it: 1,783 arbitrary-value utilities against 24 component-level hex literals,
 * roughly seventy to one. `text-[13px]` names a value exactly as much as
 * `#1a1b26` does.
 *
 * Implements docs/token-contract.md §4 (type), §5 (radius), §6 (tracking).
 *
 * ── WHY THE VALUES ARE EXPORTED, NOT JUST THE NAMES ──────────────────────────
 * `@hollis-labs/eslint-config-design`'s `no-arbitrary-scale` rule has to tell
 * two things apart that need different treatment:
 *
 *   text-[13px]   restates `text-control` exactly   → unambiguous autofix
 *   text-[10.5px] is off the scale entirely         → a real violation
 *
 * It cannot do that from names. Until this file existed, that package carried
 * `CONTRACT_STEP_VALUES` as a documented fallback — flagged in its own source as
 * the one place it restates the contract, which is the third-list-that-drifts
 * problem the generated-CSS design exists to prevent. These three maps delete it.

/* ────────────────────────────── TYPE SCALE ───────────────────────────────── */

/**
 * The four steps the contract ADDS. Tailwind v4 has no step below 12px and this
 * portfolio's UI density lives at 10–11px, so 712 arbitrary uses were people
 * reaching for a step that does not exist. A second gap sits at 13px.
 *
 * They get ROLE names rather than `2xs`/`3xs` ordinals because the sizes carry
 * role, measurably: at 8–9px, 44% of uses are uppercase and 54% mono; at 12px
 * that is 1% and 8%. An agent choosing between `text-2xs` and `text-3xs` is
 * guessing. Choosing `text-caption` is not.

/* ───────────────── TAILWIND'S OWN STEPS — INHERITED, IN ONE PLACE ─────────── */

/**
 * ── THE "CLOSING KEPT ALIVE" OBLIGATION ──────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Chrispian chose EXTEND NOW, REVISIT CLOSING LATER over plain "extend" — so the
 * closed semantic scale is deferred, not rejected, and this package must not
 * make closing harder. Two things that costs, both cheap, both done:
 *
 *   1. The four new steps are emitted FROM `TEXT_TOKENS`, never hand-written
 *      into CSS. See generate/css.ts.
 *   2. Tailwind's inherited steps are listed HERE, in one place, and nowhere
 *      else in this package.
 *
 * Closing the scale later is then: ban these names in the lint config, add their
 * replacements to `TEXT_TOKENS`, regenerate. It is not re-authoring components.
 *
 * ── WHAT CLOSING WOULD ACTUALLY COST, so the revisit is a decision and not a
 *    re-investigation ───────────────────────────────────────────────────────
 *
 * Cheap, and already paid for:
 *   · This package — one array edit plus a regenerate. No new abstraction was
 *     built for it; the two points above are the whole mechanism.
 *   · The lint config — `no-arbitrary-scale` already merges inherited steps with
 *     contract steps from one object. Closing means passing a smaller inherited
 *     set.
 *
 * Expensive, and NOT paid for:
 *   · EVERY VENDORED shadcn COMPONENT. They name `text-sm` and `text-xs`, the
 *     registry keeps producing them, and shadcn went tri-substrate in July 2026
 *     with Base UI as its default — so the stream of new vendored components
 *     naming Tailwind steps continues indefinitely. Closing means rewriting each
 *     one on arrival, forever. This is the cost that decided "extend".
 *   · Measured today: `text-xs` 1,098 uses, `text-sm` 766, `text-base` 42,
 *     `lg`+ 90 across the two implementations. ~2,000 call sites to rewrite, of
 *     which the ones inside vendored components recur with every registry pull.
 *
 * ── AND THE ASYMMETRY THAT MAKES THE DOOR WORTH HOLDING OPEN ─────────────────
 * Extend-then-close BREAKS every consumer that used a step you remove.
 * Close-then-open is purely ADDITIVE. That is why closing was kept alive rather
 * than settled now: it is the reversible direction, and nothing above forecloses
 * it.
