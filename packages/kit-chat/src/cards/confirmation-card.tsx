/**
 * A decision, presented as a card: here is what will happen, do you want it.
 *
 * ============================================================================
 * THE SPLIT THIS CARD EXISTS TO DEMONSTRATE
 * ============================================================================
 *
 * Nanite's `ConfirmationCard` is two things fused: "a confirm dialog in a card" and
 * "Nanite's plan-approval flow". It branches on `data_source.kind === 'plan_approval'`,
 * fetches the plan through `lib/api`, and calls `useApprovePlan` / `useRejectPlan`.
 * Measured 2026-09-12, it reaches into six app surfaces.
 *
 * A CARD SHAPE IS NOT A DOMAIN INTERACTION. What is general here is: a titled
 * proposal, a list of actions with tones, a submitted answer, and a resolved state
 * that survives reload. What is Nanite's is which endpoint approves a plan. So this
 * takes `actions` and a responder, and the plan-approval behaviour stays in the app —
 * which is also why this card has no data fetching, no query client, and no idea what
 * a plan is.
 *
 * RESOLVED STATE SURVIVES RELOAD, and that is the whole reason `priorStatus` is a
 * prop rather than internal state. A confirmed card that reads unconfirmed after a
 * refresh invites a second submission, and the second one 409s. The host passes
 * whatever the wire recorded and this card classifies it — see `lib/response.ts` for
 * why that input is an open string.
