# @hollis-labs/design-tokens

Layer 2 of the Hollis Labs frontend layering: **the token contract** — the names,
and their types — plus default values for them.

> **The one rule: a component may name a token, never a value.**
> It covers **scale** as much as colour. `text-[13px]` names a value exactly as
> much as `#1a1b26` does — and scale is the larger half, by about seventy to one.

No React. No components. No framework. No dependencies.

Implements the token contract (CW-20260910-0111, approved review round 2). Built
by CW-20260910-0124 as a **synthesis of two working implementations** —
`libs/sysop-ui` and `apps/nanite` — not an extraction of either.

Section references below (§3, §10, …) are to that contract, which lives at
[`docs/token-contract.md`](https://github.com/hollis-labs/design-kit/blob/main/docs/token-contract.md)
in this repo.

## Install and use

```bash
npm install @hollis-labs/design-tokens
```

### With Tailwind v4 — the normal case

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-tokens/design-tokens.css";
```

That is the whole setup. You now have `bg-surface`, `text-fg-muted`,
`border-border-subtle`, `rounded-panel`, `text-control`, `tracking-label`, the
shadcn alias layer, and ten themes that swap by attribute.

```html
<html data-theme="dir-a" data-mode="light">
```

- **`data-theme`** picks the theme. Omit it and you get the default, `dir-a`.
- **`data-mode="light"`** picks light. `class="light"` works too, because that is
  what Nanite's stylesheet already keys off.

Bring your own values instead of the built-ins:

```css
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-tokens/tokens.css";   /* the contract, no values */
```

…then declare `--hl-*` yourself, or generate it (see *Emitting your own themes*).

### Without Tailwind

`themes.css` is plain CSS custom properties, and `tokens.css` publishes the
contract layer as ordinary `--color-*` variables at `:root` as well as through
`@theme`. So `var(--color-fg)` works in hand-written CSS with no build step.

### From JavaScript

```ts
import {
  COLOR_TOKENS, TEXT_SCALE, BUILTIN_THEMES, getBuiltinTheme, applyTheme, readToken,
} from '@hollis-labs/design-tokens'
```

## The two layers

```
--hl-*       layer 3   VALUES     the ONLY layer that may name a colour
--color-*    layer 2   CONTRACT   what @theme exposes; what a component names
```

A component names `bg-surface` and touches neither. This indirection is **Nanite's
design**, not a new one — `index.css` already maps `--color-surface: var(--c-surface)`.
Only the value-layer prefix changed, from `--c-*` to `--hl-*`, decided in review
round 2: the value layer is internal, and a two-character prefix on public npm has
real collision surface.

`--color-*` is not a choice. Tailwind v4 requires that namespace to generate
`bg-*` / `text-*` / `border-*` utilities.

---

## The calls CW-0124 was asked to make, and why

### CSS-first or TS-first for values? — **Hybrid, and here is the "why"**

Neither alone, and the task asked for an argument rather than an assumption:

- **The CSS is authoritative at runtime.** One stylesheet, zero JavaScript, every
  theme. That is sysop-ui's property, it is what makes first paint correct and a
  server-rendered page themeable, and it is the only version that works for a
  consumer with no bundler.
- **The TypeScript is authoritative as a source.** It is the only form that can be
  type-checked, that a theme editor can enumerate, and that a charting library can
  read as strings.

The failure of picking one is symmetric and observable: CSS-only is what left
sysop-ui with no type contract at all, and TS-only is what makes Nanite need a
runtime step before anything is themed. **Generating one from the other gets both
properties from one source** — which is the only reason a hybrid is not just two
problems. Direction is TS → CSS (§10), the generated CSS is committed, and
`npm run generate:check` fails if the two disagree.

### One prefix or two? — **Two.** See *The two layers*.

### Dark/light as modes, or as sibling palettes? — **Modes, with dark-only allowed**

Nanite's model, which is the more conventional and more useful one. But
sysop-ui's four palettes are **alternates, not modes** — `p1-green-phosphor` has
no light variant and does not acquire one by being asked. So `Theme.tokens.light`
is optional. This is the package's **one deviation from the contract as written**;
see *Findings* below.

### `@theme inline` for colours — **yes, and it is load-bearing**

Without `inline`, Tailwind resolves `--color-bg` at `:root`, so a `[data-theme]`
on anything below `<html>` silently changes nothing — descendants inherit an
already-resolved value. With it, the utility references `var(--hl-bg)` and
resolves at the element, so a themed *subtree* works. sysop-ui found this; Nanite
gets away without it only because its mode marker sits on the root.

Scale steps go in a plain `@theme` block: a scale step has no value layer beneath
it, and consumers benefit from `var(--text-label)` existing.

---

## `chart-1..5` ARE PLACEHOLDERS. Read this before using them.

Every built-in theme sets all five to the **same magenta**, and
`theme.chartPalette === 'placeholder'` says so in the data.

This is deliberate and it is not an oversight. The chart family is the one family
neither implementation had, and review round 2 was explicit: **the names enter the
contract; the palette is Chrispian's design pass.** Five categorical colours that
stay mutually distinguishable across ten themes — two of them phosphor palettes,
one high-contrast — and survive colourblindness is real design work.

Five identical magentas make a chart *obviously* wrong. Five plausible colours
would make it *quietly* unreviewed, and plausible-and-unreviewed is precisely how
four invented token names reached production in two separately-reviewed codebases.

```ts
import { hasDesignedChartPalette, getBuiltinTheme } from '@hollis-labs/design-tokens'
hasDesignedChartPalette(getBuiltinTheme('dir-a'))   // false, for every built-in
```

A test asserts this. When the design pass lands, that test should be updated
deliberately — not deleted in passing.

---

## Where the values came from

Both working implementations survive **whole**, because CW-0124 is explicit that
losing either costs the epic its working examples.

| Themes | From | Modes |
|---|---|---|
| `dir-a` (Graphite & Ink — **the default**), `dir-b`, `dir-d`, `dir-e`, `dir-f`, `nanite-default` (Concrete & Signal) | `apps/nanite` | dark **and** light |
| `sysop-p4-white`, `sysop-green-phosphor`, `sysop-amber-phosphor`, `sysop-hi-contrast` | `libs/sysop-ui` | dark only |

Nanite's typed half was re-verified rather than trusted: **12 value sets × 40
keys, one key set, zero drift.** The claim holds exactly.

### Why `dir-a` is the default, and not Nanite's own

Decided by Chrispian on the §12.6 question the contract left open. The obvious
inheritance was `nanite-default`, and it fails the one thing a default for this
package has to do — **demonstrate the contract it ships.** Direction C sets
`warning` and `danger` to the same red (`#d4202e`), and its `success` (`#c0c4c8`)
and `info` (`#98a0a8`) are both greys: three colours across four semantics. That
is Direction C working exactly as designed — *"cool concrete, brand red as the
only signal"* — which makes it a coherent theme and a poor default for a package
whose contract just promoted `success`/`warning`/`info`/`danger` to first-class
names.

Two criteria picked `dir-a`:

- **Semantic conventionality.** Green / amber / red / blue in the expected roles,
  so the default *teaches* the contract rather than merely satisfying it.
  `dir-b` was the other muted candidate, and its `success` is gold — which reads
  as a warning. `dir-d` and `dir-e` are distinct but loud; Synthwave and
  Hacker/Terminal are aesthetic statements, not neutral starting points.
- **Light mode.** All four sysop palettes are dark-only, so any of them as the
  default would make the out-of-box experience dark-only while
  `Theme.tokens.light` is optional. All six Nanite themes carry both.

`dir-a` is the only built-in that is both conventional and unopinionated, and its
muted register reads as a starting point rather than as someone's choice.
`nanite-default` remains a built-in; nothing is wrong with it except being the
default. A test asserts the default's four feedback colours are distinct and that
it carries light, so this decision cannot be undone by accident.

### The 168 values nobody chose — `DERIVED_TOKEN_VALUES`

A contract token that neither source had a value for. Filling them mechanically is
how this package ships complete themes without inventing a palette; **exporting
the list is how that stays honest.** None of these has been through design review.

```ts
import { DERIVED_TOKEN_VALUES } from '@hollis-labs/design-tokens'
```

Four rules produced all 168 — 88 from R1–R3, 80 from R4 — applied once, offline, with
the results written into the theme files as literal colours so every value stays
inspectable and a theme editor still works:

| | Rule | Why it is a derivation and not an invention |
|---|---|---|
| **R1** | `X-muted` = `X` at 12% alpha | The contract's own definition — "`-muted` always means a low-alpha tint used as a background" (§3.8 rule 3). Names no new colour. |
| **R2** | `X-hover` = `X` 12% toward white · `X-active` = `X` 12% toward black · `surface-active` = `surface-hover` 15% toward `fg` | A magnitude, not a hue. sysop-ui's palettes have no interaction states for `primary`/`brand`/`danger` at all; the alternative was repeating the base colour and shipping a button that does not respond. |
| **R3** | `X-fg` = white or the theme's own `bg`, whichever contrasts more (WCAG) | **Measured, and reported rather than asserted:** this rule reproduces **39 of the 48** `-fg` values Nanite's authors chose by hand. The nine misses are all cases where they preferred white on a saturated red or orange at *lower* measured contrast. So these are contrast-maximal, not style-matched, and a design pass should expect to move some. |
| **R4** | `syntax-*` = five stops at 100/75/50/25/0 between the palette's own `fg` and `fg-faint`, in oklab | **The endpoints are `fg` and `fg-faint` themselves**, so only three middle stops are new and every one is a lightness step between two colours the palette already chose. Unlike R1–R3 this fills a family no palette ever had, which is why it needed §3.10 to exist first. The floor is `fg-faint` and not `bg`, and that was measured: running to the background drops the bottom two stops to 1.9 / 1.8 / 1.6 / 1.4 : 1 across the sysop palettes — below AA in all four. |

Which tokens they cover:

- **Nanite's six** need only `warning-fg` and `info-fg` — the two members the
  rectangularity rule (§3.8 rule 1) adds. 24 values.
- **sysop-ui's four** each need the same **sixteen**: every `-muted` tint, every
  feedback `-fg`, `surface-active`, and the interaction states for `primary`,
  `brand` and `danger`. 64 values. That list is a fair description of what a
  dense dark-only ops palette never needed.
- **R4 applies to all ten**, in every mode they declare — 80 values. It is the
  one rule that is uniform across the set, because it is not patching a gap in
  any particular palette: no palette ever had a syntax family.

Three more gaps were filled from values that **already exist** in `index.css`
outside Nanite's `TokenKey` union, so they are carried rather than derived:
`divider`, `selection-fg` (`var(--c-fg)`), and `ring` (`var(--c-primary)`). These
are exactly the names §10 identifies as having drifted out of the typed half.

### The mapping tables

**sysop-ui → contract**, applied identically to all four palettes:

| contract | from | note |
|---|---|---|
| `bg` | `bg` | |
| `bg-elevated` | `panel-2` | what shadcn `card`/`popover` already resolve to |
| `surface` | `panel-2` | what shadcn `muted`/`secondary`/`accent` already resolve to |
| `surface-hover` | `panel-hover` | value-identical to `panel-2` in every palette (§12.3) |
| `fg` / `-secondary` / `-muted` / `-faint` | `text` / `text-muted` / `text-soft` / `text-subtle` | |
| `border` | `border` | 100% — the default edge |
| `border-subtle` | `border-strong` | the 80%-alpha one, finally named for what it does |
| `divider` | `border-soft` | 70% alpha — the row separator it actually was |
| `primary` / `brand` | `accent` | the kit collapses these; a theme may set them equal (§3.4) |
| `primary-fg` / `brand-fg` | `accent-foreground` | |
| `selection` / `selection-fg` / `ring` | `panel-2` / `text` / `ring` | |
| `success` / `info` | `status-done` / `status-doing` | §3.5 evidence 4 |
| `danger` / `warning` | `danger` / `warning` | |

Dropped, because they are dead in their own codebase: all 8 `sidebar-*`,
`panel-hover-soft`, `panel-overlay`, `panel-overlay-strong`, `shadow`,
`shadow-strong`. The kit's 12 workflow status colours are **dashboard idiom** (§9.2)
and belong to `kit-dashboard`, which still has them in its own `theme.css` — nothing
was lost.

**Corrected at publish, 2026-09-11 (CW-20260910-0131):** an earlier version of this
paragraph said CW-0125 moves them under the `dash` prefix. It did not. `kit-dashboard`
names them `status-*` today, from its own theme values, and they resolve — all 28
colour names its `lib/status.ts` reaches for are declared, verified in a consumer's
compiled stylesheet. So the `dash` prefix is **reserved and unused**, and `status-*`
remains what the kit actually ships. Moving the kit onto contract values at all is
CW-20260911-0071, deliberately not in the first release.

**Nanite → contract** is nearly the identity: it already uses the contract names.
`mode-*` becomes `chat-mode-*` idiom, `status-ok/warn/danger` dissolves into
`success`/`warning`/`danger`, and the six dead `composer-*` names are not carried.

---

## Closing the type scale later — what it would cost

Chrispian chose **extend now, revisit closing later** over plain "extend", so the
closed semantic scale is *deferred, not rejected*. Two things that obliges, both
done, neither expensive:

1. The four new steps are emitted **from `TEXT_TOKENS`**, never hand-written into
   CSS.
2. Tailwind's inherited steps live in **one place** — `INHERITED_TEXT_STEPS` in
   `src/scales.ts` — and nowhere else in this package.

A test (`THE CLOSING-KEPT-ALIVE INVARIANT`) asserts that no added step shares a
name or a value with an inherited one, so the two sets stay separable.

**Cheap, already paid for:** this package (one array edit plus a regenerate — no
abstraction was built for it) and the lint config (`no-arbitrary-scale` already
merges inherited and contract steps from one object).

**Expensive, and not paid for:** every vendored shadcn component. They name
`text-sm` and `text-xs`, the registry keeps producing them, and shadcn went
tri-substrate in July 2026 with Base UI as its default — so the stream of new
vendored components naming Tailwind steps continues indefinitely. Closing means
rewriting each on arrival, forever. Measured today: `text-xs` 1,098 uses, `text-sm`
766, `text-base` 42, `lg`+ 90 — roughly 2,000 call sites, of which the vendored
ones recur with every registry pull.

**And the asymmetry that makes the door worth holding open:** extend-then-close
*breaks* every consumer that used a removed step; close-then-open is purely
*additive*. Closing is the reversible direction, and nothing here forecloses it.

---

## Findings — where this implementation disagrees with what it was handed

Reported rather than worked around, per the epic's standing rule. Five separate
measured claims in this epic have turned out to count something other than what
they named; these are re-derivations, not inherited numbers.

1. **The contract's `Theme` type is unimplementable as written, given CW-0124's
   own requirements.** §10 makes `tokens.light` required; CW-0124 requires
   sysop-ui's dark-only palettes to survive and be demonstrable. Satisfying both
   means inventing four light palettes, which is a design pass. Implemented with
   `light?:`, which loses nothing — `Record<ColorToken, string>` still forces
   completeness on whichever modes a theme declares, so the no-drift property the
   requirement existed for is intact. **This is the one place the contract was not
   implemented literally.**

2. **"+18 generated shadcn aliases" is not what §3.7's table contains.** The table
   yields **24** alias names, of which **8** map a name onto itself (`primary`,
   `border`, `ring`, `chart-1..5`) and so generate nothing — leaving **16**
   actually generated. 18 is shadcn's core-name count, not a generated-alias
   count. All 24 are exported as vocabulary (that is what stops
   `primary-foreground` reading as invented); 16 are emitted.

3. **"5 `[data-theme]` palettes" in sysop-ui is 4.** `theme.css` has four
   `[data-theme]` selectors plus a `:root` fallback that duplicates `p4-white`
   declaration for declaration. A fallback, not a fifth palette.

4. **The kit's dead-name count is 16 of 56 (29%), not 12 (21%)** — worse, not
   better. The contract's twelve, plus `card`, `warning`, `shadow` and `overlay`.
   Two of those matter:
   - **`--color-warning` has zero references in the kit.** §3.5's first piece of
     evidence for promoting the feedback family is "`warning` is already in both
     implementations independently… it arrived there without coordination." True
     of the *declaration*; the kit never uses it. The promotion still stands —
     arguments 4 and 5 are the strong ones and neither depends on this — but the
     independent-convergence argument is weaker than stated.
   - **`--color-overlay` has 1 reference, not 3, and it is inside `theme.css`
     itself** (`.hud-modal-overlay`). That strengthens §8's decision to leave
     overlay untokenised.

5. **§3.3's mapping table is a component-usage migration, not a value mapping,
   and using it as one would lose data.** It sends both kit `border` and kit
   `border-strong` to contract `border`, which discards one of two distinct values
   and leaves `border-subtle` with none. For *values* this package maps
   `border`→`border` (100%), `border-strong`→`border-subtle` (80%),
   `border-soft`→`divider` (70%) — which preserves all three and puts the
   intensity ordering the right way round for the first time. The usage migration
   in `DEPRECATED_TOKENS` follows §3.3 exactly, as it should.

6. **§3.8 rule 2 does not match the token list.** The prose gives `-hover` *and*
   `-active` to `primary`, `brand`, `danger` and `surface`; the list gives
   `danger` only `-hover`. Implemented as listed (§3.5 says so explicitly), and
   the test asserts the shipped set rather than the prose.

7. **The scale values agree exactly with the lint package's fallback.** §4/§5/§6
   state them in tables, so there was no derivation freedom: `micro` 9, `caption`
   10, `label` 11, `control` 13, `panel` 10, `control` 6, `tracking-label` 0.18.
   A test pins the agreement so the day `CONTRACT_STEP_VALUES` is deleted is a
   deliberate day. **Procedural note:** I read `vocabulary.js` before deriving
   these, to learn the export names the hard requirement asked for — so this is a
   confirmation, not a blind second derivation.

8. **`@layer components` in `theme.css` is NOT tokens** — it is nine `.hud-*`
   classes, kit-dashboard idiom, and it stays there. **But `@layer base` partly
   is generic**, and both implementations wrote it independently: the same
   scrollbar suppression (`scrollbar-width: none` + `::-webkit-scrollbar
   { display: none }`) and the same document-shell lock
   (`html, body, #root { height: 100% }` + `overflow: hidden`) appear in
   sysop-ui's `theme.css` and Nanite's `index.css`, neither importing the other.
   That is the same independent-convergence evidence the contract used to justify
   the shadcn core. It is not tokens and it is not in this package — it belongs
   in `design-app-runtime`, and it is a finding for CW-0126.

9. **Confirmed, independently:** the four invented token names are live, at the
   sites reported — `status-running` ×6 (`settings-panel.tsx:97,117`),
   `status-info` ×6 (`SystemPromptsViewer.tsx`), `bg-bg-surface` ×3
   (`BooleanChoice`/`CardRadio`/`Drawer`), `warning-fg` ×1
   (`SkillDetailView.tsx:421`). `warning-fg` is now a real token, so one of the
   four is fixed by the contract rather than by a rewrite.

---

## Emitting your own themes

The generator is exported, so a consumer or a kit can produce CSS the same way
this package does.

```ts
import { emitThemeCss, emitContractCss } from '@hollis-labs/design-tokens'
emitThemeCss(myTheme)     // [data-theme="…"] { --hl-*: … }
```

At runtime, for a user-authored theme or a live editor:

```ts
import { applyTheme, setMode } from '@hollis-labs/design-tokens'
applyTheme(myTheme)   // one <style> element, value layer only
setMode('light')
```

`applyTheme` overrides **only** the value layer, so the contract layer and every
utility keep working underneath it. Every DOM helper is a no-op outside a browser
— a tokens package gets imported during SSR and during tests and should not care.

### For a kit adding idiom tokens (§9)

An idiom extension carries an idiom prefix, may only **add**, and may never
shadow a contract name. Claim the prefix in `IDIOM_PREFIXES` — a one-line PR, so
two kits claiming the same prefix is a merge conflict rather than a silent
overlap. Then emit your own two layers in your own package:

```css
@theme inline { --color-dash-status-doing: var(--hl-dash-status-doing); }
[data-theme="sysop-p4-white"] { --hl-dash-status-doing: rgb(96 165 250); }
```

Reserved today: `dash` (kit-dashboard), `chat` (kit-chat).
**Burned:** `status` — sysop-ui uses it for 12 workflow lifecycle states and
Nanite for 3 health states; same prefix, incompatible meanings, both live, so it
is available to neither. **Retired:** `sidebar`.

---

## Working on this package

```bash
npm run build            # tsc -> dist/
npm run generate         # rewrite css/ from the TypeScript
npm run generate:check   # fail if committed css/ has drifted
npm run test:run         # 54 tests, including the drift check
npm run typecheck
```

**`css/` is generated. Do not edit it by hand.** TypeScript is the source; run
`npm run generate` and commit the result. `generate:check` runs inside the test
suite, so a hand-edit fails CI — that is the `--check` mode §10 asks for, wired
into a gate that already runs everywhere rather than into a new job.

Source imports carry `.js` extensions on purpose: TypeScript resolves them to the
`.ts` file and emits them unchanged, so `dist/` runs in Node with no rewrite step
and no bundler.

## Published

`0.1.0`, the first release, alongside the five other packages in this repo — see the
repo's [`CHANGELOG.md`](https://github.com/hollis-labs/design-kit/blob/main/CHANGELOG.md).

Verified before release by `npm pack` and installed into a scratch project with no
other design-kit package present — no React, no transitive dependencies at all, both
palette sets demonstrable there through a real Tailwind v4 build. At publish it was
verified again from the tarball in a browser: `Metric`'s value computed to
`rgb(244, 244, 245)` against the contract's `#f4f4f5` for `fg`, its label to
`rgb(82, 82, 91)` against `#52525b` for `fg-faint`, and the four added type steps
measured 9 / 10 / 11 / 13 px with `rounded-panel` at 10px and `rounded-control` at
6px — the declared values, on a screen, through a consumer's own Tailwind build.
