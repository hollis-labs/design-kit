# @hollis-labs/kit-chat

**The chat idiom** — a composer and a transcript. Props down, messages up: no stores,
no data fetching, no API client, no plugin system. The host owns state; these
components own presentation and interaction.

> **The one rule: a component may name a token, never a value.**
> It covers **scale** as much as colour.

## Tailwind compatibility

Styled components require **Tailwind CSS v4**, declared as a required
`tailwindcss: ^4.0.0` peer. npm 7+ installs a missing required peer automatically;
npm 11's default resolver rejects an installed incompatible major. An automatic
peer install does not add Tailwind to your app's manifest or configure its CSS
build. Declare it explicitly and configure the matching Vite/PostCSS/CLI
integration:

```sh
npm install -D tailwindcss@^4.0.0
```

A successful install alone does not verify styling. Follow this package's usage
instructions for the CSS imports and source registration as well.

## Install — and the line that is not optional

```bash
npm install @hollis-labs/kit-chat @hollis-labs/design-components @hollis-labs/design-tokens
npm install @base-ui/react react react-dom lucide-react     # peers
```

```css
/* your app's stylesheet */
@import "tailwindcss";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-tokens/design-tokens.css";
@import "@hollis-labs/design-components/source.css";
@import "@hollis-labs/kit-chat/source.css";          /* ← THIS ONE */
```

**Leave out that last line and styling fails silently.** The base-component or
host scan can emit some shared utilities, leaving a partially styled transcript
that looks plausible. See the
[adopter-path guide](https://github.com/hollis-labs/design-kit/blob/main/docs/adopter-path.md)
for complete values, source wiring and focused computed-style verification.
Restart the dev server
after stylesheet import changes before checking a fresh production build.

Tailwind v4 emits a utility only for a class string it has *seen*, and it does not scan
`node_modules`. This package's class strings ship inside `dist`, so without something
pointing Tailwind at them the utilities are never generated. There is no error to read,
because the defect is in what your build did not produce rather than in anything the
code says.

`design-components/source.css` is a **separate import and both are needed** — this
package composes its primitives, so their class strings live in a different `dist`.

[Consumer verification](docs/consumer-verification.md) records the registry
0.1.0 browser measurements, source-registration negative control, typography
defect and packed-candidate fix. Import resolution alone does not verify styling.

## Use

```tsx
import { ChatInput, ChatStream, useStallDetector } from '@hollis-labs/kit-chat'
import type { ChatItem, ChatTrigger } from '@hollis-labs/kit-chat'

function Chat() {
  const [items, setItems] = useState<ChatItem[]>([])
  const [draft, setDraft] = useState('')
  const [partial, setPartial] = useState<string | null>(null)
  const stalled = useStallDetector(partial)

  const triggers: readonly ChatTrigger[] = [
    { id: 'files', kind: 'reference', char: '@', items: files },
    { id: 'commands', kind: 'command', char: '/', atLineStart: true,
      items: commands, onSelect: (c) => run(c.id) },
  ]

  return (
    <div className="flex h-full flex-col">
      <ChatStream
        items={items}
        status={partial === null
          ? { status: 'idle' }
          : { status: stalled ? 'stalled' : 'streaming', role: 'assistant', content: partial }}
      />
      <ChatInput value={draft} onValueChange={setDraft} onSubmit={send} triggers={triggers} />
    </div>
  )
}
```

---

## `ChatInput`

A controlled composer. Enter submits, Shift+Enter inserts a newline.
The framed composer includes a visible Send action, so touch users can submit
without a keyboard shortcut. Enter used to commit an IME candidate does not send.

`busy` keeps the draft editable and disables sending. Supply `onStop` to show a
Stop action that calls your cancellation handler. Set `showSubmitButton={false}`
when your `toolbarEnd` already supplies an action; existing toolbar slots remain.

### Two trigger kinds, because they are two different operations

| | `ReferenceTrigger` | `CommandTrigger` |
|---|---|---|
| Example | `@` a file | `/` a command |
| On select | inserts `value ?? label` **as text in the message** | reports the choice and **inserts nothing** |
| Carries | `suffix`, optional `onInsert` | **required** `onSelect` |

A reference becomes part of what gets sent. A command is a choice — it may set a
pending mode, clear the composer, or fire an action, and assuming it inserts text is
wrong. Typing them as one shape with a different character is how a props surface grows
an options bag, so they are two types and **a command trigger without an `onSelect` does
not compile**.

Selecting a command removes the `/query` span, because leaving `/cle` behind after
choosing `clear` is wrong in every host. Beyond that the host owns `value`, so its
`onSelect` may set the composer to anything and its write lands after ours.

**Both are host-supplied.** This package does not know what a file is, what commands
exist, or how to search either.

### Why a textarea rather than a rich editor

Measured as kB added to a consumer's `node_modules`: TipTap **14,832**, Lexical
**23,968**, this route **0** — `cmdk` is already a runtime dependency of
`@hollis-labs/design-components` and the primitives are already exported from it.

The cost, stated: a textarea cannot render a mention as an inline chip. What it gives
back is plaintext fidelity on submit, which is what a chat message is.

### Other props worth knowing

- **`history`** — previously sent messages, newest last; ArrowUp from an empty composer
  walks back through them. Prop-driven on purpose: Nanite keeps this in `localStorage`
  at module scope, which means two composers on a page share one history and a test
  cannot control it.
- **`menuSide`** — `'top'` (default) or `'bottom'`. The component does **not** measure
  available space; auto-flipping needs a positioning dependency or hand-rolled
  measurement, and a composer at the bottom of a transcript never needs it. A host that
  places the composer mid-page knows something the component cannot.

---

## `ChatStream`

The transcript. Renders an ordered list of items the host provides.
The default content column is bounded at `max-w-3xl`. Plain string messages
preserve newlines and wrap long tokens; rendered nodes keep their own formatting.

Pass `loading` while fetching the initial conversation to show progress instead
of the empty state. The optional `history` prop renders an older-history action,
loading feedback, and a retry action without fetching anything:

```tsx
<ChatStream
  items={items}
  loading={initialLoading}
  history={{ hasOlder, loading: loadingOlder, error: historyError,
    onLoadOlder: loadOlder }}
/>
```

### Paginated history

`useChatHistory({ loadPage, initialPage? })` connects bounded, oldest-first pages
to this seam. The host supplies an async page loader; the hook handles cursors,
overlap by stable item ID, single-flight requests, retry and cancellation. It loads
the latest window once, then older windows only when requested. `append` upserts
live items without losing messages that arrived during a history request.

```tsx
const transcript = useChatHistory({ loadPage })
<ChatStream items={transcript.items} loading={transcript.loading} history={transcript.history} />
```

Key the containing component by conversation/window to reset it. An optional
`initialPage` seeds a hydrated or search-selected window without a latest request.
The host chooses page size, transport and rendering; the hook neither fetches nor
evicts rows. [History adapter contract and browser proof](docs/message-history.md)
includes integration, cursor rules and the prepend fix.

`ChatStream` delegates cursors, deduplication and request state to the host or
the headless hook above; its history prop remains presentation only.

### Scroll is the hard part and this package does not own it

`@shadcn/react`'s `MessageScroller` handles it: anchoring a turn, releasing the view
when the reader scrolls away, holding position when history is prepended, and staying
stable when content reflows under a stream. It has **zero runtime dependencies**, adds
76 kB, and is headless, so it needs no `@source` of its own.

Verified against a 30-message transcript in a browser: prepending ten older messages
moved the reader **0 px** while the scroll height grew.

### The item model

```ts
type ChatItem = ChatMessageItem | ChatMarkerItem | ChatCardItem
```

A discriminated union on `kind`, not a message with optional fields — so a "message"
carrying a marker's label and no content does not typecheck. `renderItem` replaces
rendering wholesale, and the default renderer's `switch` ends in a `never`, so a new
variant that nobody handled is a compile error rather than a blank row.

By default a **user** turn gets a bubble and an **assistant** turn runs full width,
because assistant content is usually rich and a bubble sized to a conversational line
squeezes a table into a column.

A **card** is a sibling variant rather than a field on a message. A card nested
inside a message would force every consumer of `ChatMessageItem` to know about
envelopes, and force a card to inherit a `role` and an author it does not have.

### Streaming state, and why stall is yours to assert

```ts
type ChatStreamStatus =
  | { status: 'idle' }
  | { status: 'streaming'; role: ChatRole; content: ReactNode }
  | { status: 'stalled';   role: ChatRole; content: ReactNode }
  | { status: 'error';     message: ReactNode }
```

A partially-arrived reply renders outside the item list, because it is not a message
yet.
Streaming shows Responding feedback even before the first token. A stalled reply
keeps its content and shows a waiting message; an error renders an alert. Loading
icons respect reduced motion.

**`ChatStream` cannot detect a stall itself**, and that is a real consequence of it
taking already-rendered content: two renders of the same text are two different
`ReactNode` objects, so it cannot tell "a token arrived" from "the host re-rendered".
Only you hold something that changes exactly when content does. `useStallDetector`
ships the timer so nobody rewrites it:

```tsx
const stalled = useStallDetector(accumulatedText)   // 2000 ms default — Nanite's value
```

---

## `@hollis-labs/kit-chat/markdown` — optional

**You only need this if you want us to render markdown for you.** `ChatStream` takes
already-rendered content, so a host with its own pipeline imports none of this and
installs nothing extra.

```bash
npm install streamdown        # an optional peer — not installed unless you ask
```

```css
@import "@hollis-labs/kit-chat/markdown.css";   /* ← required, see below */
@import "streamdown/styles.css";                /* streamdown's own keyframes */
```

```tsx
import { ChatMarkdown } from '@hollis-labs/kit-chat/markdown'

<ChatMarkdown streaming={isStreaming}>{markdownSource}</ChatMarkdown>
```

`streaming` maps to streamdown's `mode` and it matters: in streaming mode it repairs
unterminated constructs, so a half-written fence renders as a code block instead of as
literal backticks. Every other `StreamdownProps` option passes through.

### The extra `@source`, and why we ship it

Streamdown's class strings are in *its* `dist`, so Tailwind needs to see them too.
Its own README asks you to write `@source "../node_modules/streamdown/dist/*.js"` and to
*"adjust the number of `../` segments based on where your CSS file lives"* — a glob whose
correctness depends on your directory depth, failing as silently when wrong as when
missing.

`@hollis-labs/kit-chat/markdown.css` declares it for you. `@source` resolves relative to
the file that declares it, so the path is fixed against a layout this package controls.

**It assumes `streamdown` sits in the same `node_modules` root as `@hollis-labs`**,
which is what npm, yarn and pnpm produce for a package you installed directly; verified
against a real npm install. If your layout differs, write streamdown's own line in your
stylesheet instead.

### Why streamdown, and why it is not in the base package

It adds **11,148 kB** to `node_modules` — more than the entire Base UI headless layer
this portfolio accepted — which is why it is an optional peer behind a subpath rather
than a dependency. Behind an opt-in export, buying correctness on unterminated fences
and half-written tables beats reimplementing it; in the base package it would have been
a tax on every consumer.

Rejected: `react-markdown`, whose last release was 2025-03-07 and which does not handle
partial markdown; `marked` alone, which is 488 kB but leaves the streaming-safety work
to us.

---


## The card set

Interactive cards for a transcript: the `Envelope` chassis, five presentational
shapes, three that take an answer, and the cards that draw a binding miss.
`ArtifactCard` adds compact native download/dismiss presentation, `DocumentCard`
provides a bounded pane for rendered content and host navigation/actions, and
`PromptCard` collects a controlled text answer through the existing responder.
Boolean choices use `ConfirmationCard`. See the
[Nanite/Flux reconciliation](docs/nanite-card-reconciliation.md) for usage and
the mapping to existing cards; no wire kinds or app transports are added.
Envelopes fill the transcript column, wrap long body text, and let wide tables
scroll within the card. See the [polish dogfood record](docs/polish-dogfood.md)
for the Flux gap list and browser checks in an isolated ops-chat consumer.

```tsx
import { ConfirmationCard, CardBoundary, CardMiss } from '@hollis-labs/kit-chat'

const r = resolve(table, envelope.kind)   // your table, from @hollis-labs/design-bindings

items.push({
  kind: 'card',
  id: envelope.id,
  wireKind: envelope.kind,
  content: r.ok ? (
    <CardBoundary key={envelope.id} wireKind={envelope.kind} onError={report}>
      <ConfirmationCard
        title="Apply 3 changes?"
        actions={[{ id: 'apply', label: 'Apply', primary: true }]}
        priorStatus={envelope.prior_response?.status}
        onRespond={(outcome) => submit(envelope.id, outcome)}
      />
    </CardBoundary>
  ) : (
    <CardMiss code={r.code} wireKind={envelope.kind} reason={r.reason} />
  ),
})
```

### A card is a shape, not a wire kind

There is no `ApprovalCard` here and there will not be one. A renderer keyed to a wire
kind is the design layer asserting wire identity, which the portfolio's ownership
table gives to `go-envelopes`. Your host binds *its* kinds to *these* shapes, and the
binding table is host-local by construction.

**So this kit ships no default `BindingRequest` rows.** A request names a `kind`, and
a kit that implements no kinds has none to offer. What it ships instead is the design
half of a miss: `CardMiss` draws all four codes distinguishably, and
`CardFallbackDeclined` draws the case where a fallback refuses because it could not
preserve meaning.

| component | what it is |
|---|---|
| `Envelope`, `EnvelopeHeader`, `EnvelopeBody`, `EnvelopeFooter`, `EnvelopeSection` | the chassis |
| `InfoCard`, `MetricCard`, `ProgressCard`, `TimelineCard`, `DiffCard` | presentational |
| `ConfirmationCard`, `TableCard`, `ListCard` | take an answer |
| `CardMiss`, `CardFallbackDeclined` | a kind that resolved to nothing |
| `CardBoundary` | a card that threw *while rendering* |

`accent` and `tone` are typed off `@hollis-labs/design-tokens`, so a tone leaving the
contract breaks these props rather than leaving them pointing at a token that renders
nothing.

### Responding: emit closed, read open

A card never builds the wire response. It reports an **outcome**; your host adds the
version and envelope id and transports it.

```ts
type CardOutcome =
  | { status: 'submitted'; data?; answers?; decisions? }
  | { status: 'canceled' }
```

**`partial` is absent from that union on purpose, and it is not an oversight.** A
partial submission does not work as implemented: every submission sets `responded_at`
before the handler dispatches, so a partial claims the envelope and the submission
that would *complete* the interaction gets a 409. Partial is a state you can enter and
never leave. A comment warning about that is read after the bug is written; a union
that cannot express it is a compile error before.

Reading is the opposite. `priorStatus` is a plain `string`, and
`classifyPriorResponse` is total over it:

```ts
classifyPriorResponse('partial')   // { kind: 'open' }      — does not claim
classifyPriorResponse('cancelled') // { kind: 'canceled' }  — legacy spelling
classifyPriorResponse('handling')  // { kind: 'pending' }   — not in the declared enum
classifyPriorResponse('quiesced')  // { kind: 'unrecognized', status: 'quiesced' }
```

The declared enum is four canonical values plus a legacy `cancelled`, and two more —
`handling` and `failed` — reach the column in practice. A closed union here would be a
lie that throws on data already in production databases. An unrecognised status leaves
the card **locked and names the value**, because re-enabling controls against an
unknown terminal state invites a second submission that 409s.

Resolved state is a **prop**, not internal state, so a decision survives a reload. A
confirmed card that reads unconfirmed after a refresh is how you get a double submit.

### Why there is no `ResponseV1` type here

There is no TypeScript expression of the response protocol anywhere in the portfolio:
`go-envelopes` emits envelope data types and import metadata and nothing
response-shaped, and `ResponseStatus.IsTerminal()` is Go-only. Defining one here would
make a **fourth** definition of the same thing, which is the exact failure the
protocol reconciliation was done to stop.

## Working on this package

```bash
npm run build       # tsc -p tsconfig.build.json && vite build
npm run typecheck
npm run test:run
npm run lint
```

The design rules are enforced **at zero** here from the first commit — `kit-chat` is on
the repo gate's `BLOCKING` list. There is no exemption file.

Externals are derived from `package.json` rather than listed, so the manifest and the
build cannot disagree. This matters more here than anywhere: chat libraries are where
module-level state lives, and a bundled copy of a stateful dependency fails silently.

`prepack` runs the build — not `prepare`, which runs during install and races workspace
ordering, and not `prepublishOnly`, which does not run for `npm pack` and would let a
tarball ship an empty `dist/`.

## Reasoning, ChainOfThought, Sources and Plan (unreleased)

These AI Elements ports require the **next design-components core release**:
Collapsible is in workspace source but is absent from registry design-components
0.3.0. Release this slice with design-components in the next six-package core
minor; versions/ranges stay unchanged until that coordinated release.

`Reasoning` provides controlled (`open`/`onOpenChange`) or local (`defaultOpen`)
disclosure. Streaming opens once per run, allowing user collapse during streaming, unless
explicitly opted out with
`defaultOpen={false}`, and the first completed stream closes after one second.
Supply `duration` from the host; no local elapsed-time calculation is performed.
`ReasoningContent` accepts host-rendered React content, so it imports no markdown
or syntax renderer. `ReasoningTrigger` permits a custom `getThinkingMessage`.
Its streaming label and streaming Plan text use the opt-in Shimmer stylesheet.

`ChainOfThought` and its Header/Content/Step/SearchResults/SearchResult/Image
slots present host-supplied steps and references. Header and Content share one
Base UI disclosure root, including keyboard and aria-controls wiring. Open state
is local or controlled; step `status` is purely presentational.

`Sources`, `SourcesTrigger` and `SourcesContent` compose a disclosure list.
`Source` with `href` renders an external anchor; without `href` it renders a span
for tool-use provenance or other non-link children. It resolves no citations.

`Plan` composes a Base UI Collapsible on a Card, with Header/Title/Description,
Action/Trigger, Content and Footer slots. The host supplies steps/actions; no
plan store, approval flow or executor is included. See
[demo/chat-disclosures.tsx](demo/chat-disclosures.tsx) for all four surfaces.

## Message extras and Shimmer

`MessageActions` / `MessageAction` provide host-owned action buttons with optional
Base UI tooltips. Supply `label` or `tooltip` for icon-only actions. No message
layout or markdown renderer is included.

`MessageBranch`, `MessageBranchContent`, `MessageBranchSelector`,
`MessageBranchPrevious`, `MessageBranchNext` and `MessageBranchPage` compose
alternative responses. Use one Content per Branch. Navigation wraps; inactive
branches remain mounted but hidden, preserving drafts. `defaultBranch` initializes
local selection; optional `branch` + `onBranchChange` gives the host control.
Out-of-range indices are clamped to the available alternatives. Empty and single
responses hide the selector. Branch changes never send a message or fetch content.

`Shimmer` renders text with optional `as`, `duration` (seconds) and `spread`
(highlight width multiplier). Without the stylesheet it stays ordinary readable
text. To enable the token-colored CSS sweep, import explicitly:

```css
@import "@hollis-labs/kit-chat/keyframes.css";
```

No component import installs keyframes. Reduced-motion users see static text;
`duration={0}` stops motion. No motion library is required. See
[demo/chat-core.tsx](demo/chat-core.tsx) for all three compositions and
[the upstream inventory](docs/upstream-versions.md) for provenance. The shipped
`LICENSE` retains Hollis Labs MIT terms and AI Elements Apache-2.0 attribution.

## Attachments and local file intake (unreleased)

`Attachments` supplies `grid`, `inline` or `list` layout; compose `Attachment` with
`AttachmentPreview`, `AttachmentInfo`, `AttachmentRemove`, and `AttachmentEmpty`.
`AttachmentData` is our own file/source-document presentation union (`id`, optional
`filename`/`mediaType`, file `url`, source `title`); it carries no AI SDK/wire type.
The host owns the list, object URL lifetime, validation on the server and uploads.
`onRemove` requests removal; the component never mutates the host list.

`AttachmentDropzone` wraps a local region, including an existing `ChatInput`.
Place `PromptInputActionAddAttachments` in its toolbar to open the native picker.
`onFilesSelect(File[])` reports accepted files; `onFilesReject` reports each rejected
file and `accept`, `max_file_size` or `max_files`. `accept` supports MIME patterns
and filename extensions; `multiple`, `attachmentCount`, `maxFiles`, `maxFileSize`
(bytes), and `disabled` control intake. The picker resets after every selection.
Drops stay local; ordinary text drops are left alone. Disabled file drops are
cancelled to avoid browser navigation, without emitting intake events. There are no document event
listeners, fetching, attachment stores, screenshot capture or composer trigger changes.

```tsx
<AttachmentDropzone onFilesSelect={addFiles} onFilesReject={reportRejected}
  accept="image/*,.txt" maxFiles={6} attachmentCount={attachments.length}>
  <Attachments variant="list">
    {attachments.map(data => <Attachment key={data.id} data={data}
      onRemove={() => remove(data.id)}>
      <AttachmentPreview /><AttachmentInfo /><AttachmentRemove />
    </Attachment>)}
  </Attachments>
  <ChatInput value={draft} onValueChange={setDraft} onSubmit={submit}
    toolbarStart={<PromptInputActionAddAttachments />} />
</AttachmentDropzone>
```

For expanded preview, the upstream names `AttachmentHoverCard`,
`AttachmentHoverCardTrigger`, and `AttachmentHoverCardContent` are retained, but
compose an accessible Base UI **Popover**: click/touch or keyboard activation opens
it, Escape closes it, and focus returns to its trigger. Use `render={<Button />}`
instead of Radix `asChild`; removal buttons belong outside the preview trigger.
These previews are not hover-only. Removal controls are always visible.
For attachment-only submission, supply your own host submit button in
`ChatInput.toolbarEnd` and set `showSubmitButton={false}`; the built-in ChatInput
submit intentionally depends on text. The dropzone never submits a message.
Caller-supplied media URLs are rendered by browser media elements; the host decides
which URLs are appropriate and revokes blob URLs when removed or on unmount.

Only existing published design-components 0.3.0 exports are used (Button, Popover,
PopoverTrigger, PopoverContent, cn); no new dependency or optional peer is added.
See `demo/attachments.tsx` for a host-owned list/URL lifecycle example. Browser
evidence is in `docs/attachments-a/`; unit tests exercise presentation/intake
without opening a portal (open Base UI Positioner/Popup hangs jsdom in this environment).
Real preview opening/focus/Escape is verified separately in Chromium.

## Tool, Confirmation content and Queue (unreleased)

This slice **needs the next design-components release**: Collapsible is present in
workspace source, but absent from published design-components 0.3.0. Release with
the next coordinated six-package core minor; versions/ranges are unchanged here.

`Tool`, `ToolHeader`, `ToolContent`, `ToolInput` and `ToolOutput` present a tool
lifecycle. Map host state to our `ToolState`: pending, running,
awaiting-confirmation, confirmed, completed, denied or error. Supply `toolName`
(and optional `title`); no SDK part or wire-kind name is accepted. The host owns
execution and input/output. Input/output use JsonViewer, accept React elements,
or accept arbitrary host-rendered content through children. Falsy JSON results
(false, zero, empty string, null) remain visible. `errorText` is host-supplied.

`ConfirmationTitle`, `ConfirmationRequest`, `ConfirmationAccepted` and
`ConfirmationRejected` are **content slots inside the existing ConfirmationCard**.
They throw a clear error outside that card, including Title. Title renders a
phrasing-content span and can be composed in the card title or body. There is no new
Confirmation root, action row, responder or approval type. All existing card
props, submission payloads, busy state and persisted-state locks remain intact.
Request is shown while the card is open. Accepted/Rejected require a host-selected
`actionId` and show their host-supplied children only when priorStatus classifies
as submitted and priorActionId equals that opaque ID. They never interpret action
names: a host may map any ID to either presentation. Dismissal, failure, pending
and unrecognized statuses do not imply acceptance or rejection. The card's
existing resolved status remains visible; do not place interactive controls in
these content slots.

`Queue` composes Section/Trigger/Label/Content, a bounded, keyboard-focusable
native `QueueList`, and Item/Indicator/Content/Description/Actions/Action/Attachment/
Image/File slots. Completion is presentational; hosts own list data and action
handlers. Action buttons remain visible and use a token-sized target for touch and keyboard
users. Supply an
accessible label to icon-only actions and a useful QueueList label. Filename width
and image sizing use the token scale. No queue store, executor or transport is added.
See [demo/chat-tool-queue.tsx](demo/chat-tool-queue.tsx).

## Image and InlineCitation (unreleased)

`Image` renders a native image from required host-owned `src` and `alt`, plus optional `mediaType` metadata and standard image props. An empty `alt` marks a decorative image. The host creates and releases Blob URLs, chooses data/network URLs and handles errors; the kit does no base64 conversion, MIME detection, fetching or generated-file interpretation.

`InlineCitation`, `InlineCitationText`, `InlineCitationCard`, `InlineCitationCardTrigger` and `InlineCitationCardBody` compose an inline source preview. Supply the trigger's readable label as children; destinations and source descriptions belong to the host. `InlineCitationSource` renders `title`, `url` and `description` as text, and accepts host children for explicit links/actions. `InlineCitationQuote` renders a blockquote. No URL parsing or external destination is inferred.

The `InlineCitationCarousel` family is a small pager: optional controlled `index` and `onIndexChange`, or `defaultIndex` for local selection; previous/next wrap around. Use one `InlineCitationCarouselContent` with one `InlineCitationCarouselItem` per page, plus Header, Index, Prev and Next slots. Empty/single-page navigation is disabled; invalid indexes and shrinking lists are normalized; inactive pages remain mounted but hidden. A controlled host must accept the requested index to change the displayed page. Click handlers can prevent navigation.

The interactive body uses `aria-hidden={false}` to override the supplementary HoverCard default. Keyboard focus on the trigger opens the preview; Tab enters its controls, Shift+Tab from the first returns to the trigger, and Tab from the last continues to the following host control. Escape returns focus to the trigger. HoverCard open state/callbacks still belong to Base UI/the host. This needs the next design-components release (unreleased); published 0.3.0 lacks HoverCard. No dependency, manifest or lockfile changes.

See [the demo](demo/image-citation.tsx) and [verification](docs/image-citation/verification.md). No application migration or transport changes are included.

## Model selector (unreleased)

Compose `ModelSelector` + `ModelSelectorTrigger` + `ModelSelectorContent` with
Input/List/Empty/Group/Item/Shortcut/Separator/Name. `ModelSelectorDialog` is a
controlled dialog convenience; the host supplies its opening control. Titles and
optional descriptions live inside the popup. `searchLabel` supplies the search
input's accessible name (default "Search models"), since Command owns its label.
Base UI owns dialog focus/Escape;
Command supplies filtering and keyboard selection. `onSelect` reports the host's
item value; the host owns the catalog, selected model, persistence and execution.
Use item `keywords` for additional search terms and `disabled` for unavailable models.

```tsx
<ModelSelector open={open} onOpenChange={setOpen}>
  <ModelSelectorTrigger render={<Button />}>Choose model</ModelSelectorTrigger>
  <ModelSelectorContent title="Choose a model" showCloseButton={false}>
    <ModelSelectorInput aria-label="Search models" />
    <ModelSelectorList><ModelSelectorEmpty>No matching models</ModelSelectorEmpty>
      <ModelSelectorItem value="local" onSelect={value => { select(value); setOpen(false) }}>
        <ModelSelectorLogo provider="local">{hostLogo}</ModelSelectorLogo>
        <ModelSelectorName>Local model</ModelSelectorName>
      </ModelSelectorItem>
    </ModelSelectorList>
  </ModelSelectorContent>
</ModelSelector>
```

`ModelSelectorLogo` is a **consumer ReactNode slot**, shared in approach with OpenIn.
It renders children only: no bundled brand marks, provider registry, generated URL,
fetching or theme inversion. `provider` is optional metadata (`data-provider`) and
never selects an asset. An empty slot stays empty. The consumer supplies authorized
assets and their theme appearance. Decorative logos beside a model name omit `label`;
a standalone informative logo supplies `label`. Use `ModelSelectorLogoGroup` to
compose multiple slots. Consumer logos should be noninteractive.

All imports used by this slice (Dialog/Content/Title/Description/Trigger, Command
and its list primitives, cn) exist in published design-components 0.3.0. No new
dependency or unreleased primitive is required by ModelSelector itself. Other chat
components that use Collapsible retain their separate next-release prerequisite.
See `demo/model-selector.tsx` and `docs/model-selector-b/`. Unit tests use the real
Command as a popup stand-in to avoid the known Base UI open portal/jsdom hang;
Chromium verifies the real dialog, filtering, keyboard/touch selection and focus.

## OpenIn (unreleased)

`OpenIn` receives a required host catalog of `{ id, label, href, icon?: ReactNode }`.
Supply unique stable IDs, nonempty labels, explicit absolute HTTP(S) URLs, and
noninteractive consumer-owned icon nodes. There are no default providers or brand
exports. Empty catalogs disable the trigger. Unsupported schemes and invalid or
relative URLs remain visible as disabled, non-link rows.

```tsx
<OpenIn providers={[
  { id: 'host', label: 'Open host document', href: hostApprovedHref, icon: hostIcon },
]} />
```

For composition, use `OpenInTrigger`, `OpenInContent`, `OpenInItem`, `OpenInGroup`,
`OpenInLabel` and `OpenInSeparator` inside the root. Group labels belong inside
`OpenInGroup`. The default trigger says “Open in”; provide trigger children to
change it. Base UI owns menu focus and Escape. Disabled rows remain keyboard-discoverable
but cannot activate.

Upstream OpenIn constructs provider URLs containing the full prompt. This port
has no query prop, content serialization, URL construction, provider registry or
preloading. Each valid row exposes exactly the host-supplied href, which only
leaves the page on link activation, in a new tab with `rel="noopener noreferrer"`.
The host owns destination approval, URL encoding, any content already embedded
in the URL, and consent to send it. The kit does not append chat content or send
a referrer. Consumer icons render as decorative nodes beside their labels; the
kit bundles no brand marks and fetches no icon assets. Hosts own the behavior
and asset rights of nodes they supply.

OpenIn uses published Button/DropdownMenu primitives without new dependencies.
See [demo/open-in.tsx](demo/open-in.tsx) and [verification](docs/open-in-b/verification.md).

## Suggestions, Context and Question (unreleased)

`Suggestions` is a labelled, keyboard-focusable horizontal overflow region.
`Suggestion` is a button that emits its `suggestion` string to `onClick`; it does
not send a message. Disabled buttons are inert. The host owns the next action.

`Context` accepts `usedTokens`, `maxTokens`, our optional `ContextUsage` numeric
fields (inputTokens/outputTokens/reasoningTokens/cachedInputTokens), and optional
`ContextCost` USD fields (totalUSD/inputUSD/outputUSD/reasoningUSD/cacheUSD).
No model ID, pricing catalog, AI SDK type or tokenlens is used. Costs come from the
host; totals are not calculated or inferred from missing parts. Missing, negative
and nonfinite data render **Unknown**. Known zero renders 0 or $0.00. Capacity must
be finite and positive; invalid capacity or usage produces no progress element.
Known capacity percentage/progress clamps to 0–100%; raw used/max counts remain
visible when usage exceeds capacity. Overflowing arithmetic is unknown.

Compose ContextTrigger/Content/Header/Body/Footer and Input/Output/Reasoning/Cache
Usage slots. All support host content. Preview is an accessible Base UI **Popover**
activated by keyboard/click/touch, with Escape and focus return, rather than a
hover-only card. No HoverCard or new dependency is imported.

`Question` is a presentation form with native radio (single) or checkbox (multiple)
options. Single radios use native arrow-key semantics and do not deselect when
clicked again. It accepts controlled `value`/`onValueChange` or an uncontrolled
`defaultValue`, with `{selectedValues, text}`. Compose Prompt/Description/Options/
Option/Input/Actions/Submit; label option groups and the text input. A Question
must not be nested inside another form. `selectionMode` defaults to single.
`requireText` defaults to false: a choice or trimmed text permits submission;
true requires nonblank text even when a choice exists. Input supports host
`maxLength` and other textarea constraints. `disabled` or host `pending` locks
controls/submission. Async `onSubmit(response, event)` locks synchronously against
duplicate submissions until it settles and preserves the draft. Rejections show a
retry alert and emit `onSubmitError`; no persisted completion is invented.

Free text stays in ephemeral React state (or the host-controlled value), is
rendered only through React text/textarea escaping, and is trimmed with the
built-in string operation before the submit callback. The component performs no
network requests, persistence, logging, HTML parsing or dynamic regular expressions
on user input. Callbacks receive the host's data; server validation, authorization,
transport, storage, content policy and input-length policy belong to the host.
This is not a Tangent wire protocol or a replacement ConfirmationCard.

All direct Button/Textarea/Popover/cn imports are published in design-components
0.3.0. The existing Collapsible/HoverCard-based exports in current main still **need next
design-components release (unreleased)**. No dependency/manifest/lock changes.
See `demo/context-question.tsx` and `docs/context-question-c/` for unit/Chromium,
light/dark theme and packed ChatStream-without-streamdown evidence. As with other
popover slices, unit tests cover inner Context presentation without opening the
Base UI popup in jsdom; Chromium proves real open/focus/Escape behavior.

## Expanded Artifact (unreleased)

`Artifact` is the expanded viewer shell beside the compact transcript
`ArtifactCard`. The card remains its existing Envelope presentation with
name/meta/download/dismiss props. The expanded family keeps the upstream names:
`ArtifactHeader`, `ArtifactTitle`, `ArtifactDescription`, `ArtifactClose`,
`ArtifactActions`, `ArtifactAction` and `ArtifactContent`. Neither surface is a
wire kind or chooses a renderer. Hosts decide how a compact record opens an
expanded viewer, when it closes, and what already-rendered content it contains.

```tsx
<Artifact role="region" aria-labelledby="artifact-title">
  <ArtifactHeader>
    <div><ArtifactTitle id="artifact-title">Host document</ArtifactTitle>
      <ArtifactDescription>{hostMetadata}</ArtifactDescription></div>
    <ArtifactActions>
      <ArtifactAction label="Save document" icon={DownloadIcon} onClick={hostSave} />
      <ArtifactClose onClick={hostClose} />
    </ArtifactActions>
  </ArtifactHeader>
  <ArtifactContent aria-label="Document preview">{hostRenderedContent}</ArtifactContent>
</Artifact>
```

Each `ArtifactAction` requires a nonempty `label` independent of optional tooltip
text; icon-only controls keep that accessible name. `icon` accepts a Lucide icon
component; children can supply other host-rendered content. `ArtifactClose` has
the default label “Close artifact”, overridable with a nonempty `label`. All
controls are native non-submitting buttons; `disabled` remains inert. Button
render overrides are excluded and native buttons are enforced after the prop
spread, so controls remain buttons. Tooltips use Base UI
render composition without nested buttons. An open tooltip is linked as a
description; its optional hint never replaces the required action label. Clicks
only report host callbacks; Close does not internally unmount or alter the viewer.

`ArtifactContent` is a bounded, keyboard-focusable native scrolling region,
labelled “Artifact content” by default. Supply a useful `aria-label`; hosts may
override its height/classes/tabIndex for their layout. Titles/descriptions are
paragraph slots, so the host chooses heading/region structure. No MIME detection,
fetching, HTML insertion, editor/renderer dependency or automatic download is
included. Host React children keep their own behavior and asset/URL policies.

Only published Button/Tooltip/cn exports are used by this slice; the integrated
kit-chat package still **needs next design-components release (unreleased)** for
its Collapsible/HoverCard exports. See [demo/artifact.tsx](demo/artifact.tsx) and
[verification](docs/artifact-c/verification.md).
